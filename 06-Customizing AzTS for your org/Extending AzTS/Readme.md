> The Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) was created by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft, to help accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzTS and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.
<br>AzTS is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft CSEO's best practices with the community..

## Customizing the SVTs
It is powerful capability of AzTS to enable an org to customize the SVT behaviour. You will be able to achieve the following scenarios:

   - [Add new control for existing SVT](Readme.md#add-new-control-for-existing-svt)
      - [Add new control based on custom Azure policy](AddControlForPolicy.md)
      - [Add new control based on ASC Assessment](AddControlForAssessment.md)
   - [Update/extend existing control](Note.md)
      - [Update/extend existing control by custom Azure policy](Note.md)
      - [Update/extend existing control by custom ASC Assessment](Note.md)
   - [Add new SVT altogether (non-existing SVT)](Note.md)

### Add new control for existing SVT

Azure Tenant Security Solution (AzTS) provides capability to add new controls(for existing services supported by AzTS) to customize the AzTS for your organization as per your need.
Currently you can extend AzTS controls set by either adding a new control based on custom Azure Policy or based on Azure Security Center assessment.

   - [Add new control based on ASC Assessment](AddControlForAssessment.md)
